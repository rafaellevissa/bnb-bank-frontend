# REACTJS CHALLENGE

## TECHNOLOGIES

- React
- TypeScript
- Material UI (MUI)

## REQUIREMENTS

- NPM

build a simplified banking system

the system has 2 types of users

1. a customer

2. an admin


customer user stories: 

- a user can create a new account with username and password

- a user starts with 0 balance

- a user can deposit more money to his account by uploading a picture of a check and entering the amount of the check. if the check is approved by an admin, the money is added to the bank account.
- /**
- * The picture can be of anything, you don't need to parse it or validate it in any way
- */


- to buy something, the user enters the amount and description; a user can only buy something if she has enough money to cover the cost.

- a user can see a list of balance changes including time and description.


admin user stories:

- an admin account is already created with a hard coded username and password.

- an admin can see a list of pending check deposit pictures with amount and picture and click to approve or deny the deposit.


***
Simplifying Assumptions 

* an admin canâ€™t be also a customer
